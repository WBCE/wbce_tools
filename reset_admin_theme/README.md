# WBCE - Reset Admin Theme
As we will experiment quite a lot whith themes and templates it might be a good idea to add this little tool.

## Usage
  1. Upload the script to the root of your server.
  2. Run it once by calling the url http://yourserver/resettheme.php
  3. Delete the file from the server.

Your admin now should be reset to the `WB_Theme/WBCE` default theme.
